** trying on laptop

do not have netpyne on laptop

python3
import netpyne

pip3 install netpyne

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/pip3", line 9, in <module>
    from pip import main
ImportError: cannot import name 'main'

what's wrong with pip3?

sudo python3 -m pip uninstall pip && sudo apt install python3-pip --reinstall

pip3 install netpyne

hmm, needs newer version of python (>= 3.6 ), only have python 3.5 on laptop ...

will try on neurosim ... 

python3
import netpyne
netpyne.__version__ # '0.9.3.1'

pip3 install gym --user
pip3 install atari-py --user

compile:
nrnivmodl

for running on 1 node:
py3env
python3 trainSmartAgent.py

mpirun -n 16 python trainSmartAgent.py

was able to run with 1 core, took 2.5 GB with 500 ms interval for saving weights and 1000 ms simulation
will need to record from only a small fraction of the cells
