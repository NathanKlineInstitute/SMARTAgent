** trying on laptop

do not have netpyne on laptop

python3
import netpyne

pip3 install netpyne

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/pip3", line 9, in <module>
    from pip import main
ImportError: cannot import name 'main'

what's wrong with pip3?

sudo python3 -m pip uninstall pip && sudo apt install python3-pip --reinstall

pip3 install netpyne

hmm, needs newer version of python (>= 3.6 ), only have python 3.5 on laptop ...

will try on neurosim ... 

python3
import netpyne
netpyne.__version__ # '0.9.3.1'

pip3 install gym --user
pip3 install atari-py --user

compile:
nrnivmodl

for running on 1 node:
py3env
python3 trainSmartAgent.py

mpirun -n 16 python trainSmartAgent.py

was able to run with 1 core, took 2.5 GB with 500 ms interval for saving weights and 1000 ms simulation
will need to record from only a small fraction of the cells

** make new branch to avoid conflict with haroon's work

git branch samn
git checkout samn
git add snnotes.dol
git commit -m 'new branch for samn test'
git push origin samn

make an alias for that: gpushsamn

** try compile and then run 

nrnivmodl

mpirun -n 16 python trainSmartAgent.py

myrun

mpirun -n 16 python trainSmartAgent.py

even after calling py3env to set the environment to use anaconda ... 
it's showing many different pong windows ... should only be 1 window  (this was run on zn)

aigame.py loads the gym environment with the pong game
where is aigame.py called from?

trainSmartAgent.py is the main sim setup
it imports SMARTAgent from aigame

hmm, not running it properly ...

mpiexec -n 16 python -mpi trainSmartAgent.py
